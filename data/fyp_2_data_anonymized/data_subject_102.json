Just as before, you can use either the polygon or arithmetic methods. If you need to write the operation, you can use (n), and your answers can include n to stand in for the arbitrary value if necessary. (You can use the polygon at the right to think, but it doesn't necessarily correspond to the real polygon, which is why we've left most of it dashed.)","orientation_history":[0],"rt":203566,"trial_type":"polygon-arrow-instructions","trial_index":0,"trial_index_global":64,"time_elapsed":1129560,"internal_chunk_id":"0-0"},{"nsides":"n","question":"What is the formula for the inverse of 1 under <img src=./images/ngon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>?","response_type":"free","response_choices":[],"correct_response":"n-1","response":"1 + (1+n)","orientation_history":[[0],[0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572,0.8807602102998572],[1.714379720441365,1.714379720441365,1.714379720441365,1.714379720441365,1.714379720441365,1.714379720441365,1.714379720441365,1.714379720441365],[2.3036114285814033,2.3036114285814033,2.3036114285814033,2.3036114285814033,2.3036114285814033,2.3036114285814033,2.3036114285814033,2.3036114285814033],[2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774,2.7457422122523774],[3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863,3.165397679774863],[3.30674133100442,3.30674133100442,3.30674133100442,3.30674133100442,3.30674133100442,3.30674133100442,3.30674133100442,3.30674133100442],[3.438437326966196,3.438437326966196,3.438437326966196,3.438437326966196,3.438437326966196,3.438437326966196,3.438437326966196,3.438437326966196,3.438437326966196],[3.640939375269923,3.640939375269923,3.640939375269923,3.640939375269923,3.640939375269923,3.640939375269923,3.640939375269923,3.640939375269923],[0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769,0.6769148518424769]],"response_history":["1 (n) (1+n)","1 + (1+n)"],"rt":146405,"trial_type":"polygon-arrow-question","trial_index":0,"trial_index_global":65,"time_elapsed":1275966,"internal_chunk_id":"0-0.14-0"},{"nsides":"n","question":"What is the formula for the inverse of an element x under <img src=./images/ngon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>?
