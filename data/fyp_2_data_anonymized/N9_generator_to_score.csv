"33","1","Is 2 a generator under +<sub>9</sub>? Please explain in words how you got your answer.","","No, you don't do anything to the number because 2 is less than 9.",60
"34","1","Is 3 a generator under +<sub>9</sub>? Please explain in words how you got your answer.","","No, you don't do anything to the number since 3 is less than 9. ",61

"91","2","Is 2 a generator under <img src=./images/nonagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>? Please explain in words ho w you go t your answer.","","Yes.  Because 9 is an odd number, the second pass around the circle as you keep adding 2 will pick up the odd numbers.",60
"92","2","Is 3 a generator under <img src=./images/nonagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>? Ple ase expl ain in words how you got your answer.","","No, it will be a loop of 3,6,0",61
"93","2","Is 5 a generator under <img src=./images/nonagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>? Please explain in words how you got your answer.","","Well lets, see.  The path would be starting with 5@0 --- 5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4 ",62
