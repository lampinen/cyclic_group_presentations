[{"nsides":6,"instructions":"Let's define a new operation <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>. This operation will give us a way of combining two of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to get another one of them back. Consider the hexagon at the right, where I've labeled each point with one of the numbers. To perform <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>, you can use the interactive diagram on the right, or perform the operation in your mind. Point the arrow at the first number on the hexagon by clicking, then click (or click and drag) to move the arrow the second number of points clockwise around the hexagon. The number the arrow arrives at is your result. (The operation is called <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> because it uses the hexagon, which has 6 sides.) <br /><br />For example, 3 <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 5 =  2, becau se 5 steps clockwise from 3 on the hexagon brings us to 2. So 3 <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 5 = 2.<br /><br />Similarly, 1 <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 4 = 5, because 4 steps clockwise from 1 brings us to 5. <br /><br />Click Continue when you're ready to move on.","orientation_history":[0,[5.280493712859117,5.280493712859117,5.280493712859117,5.280493712859117,5.280493712859117,5.280493712859117,5.280493712859117,5.2728985130800945,5.249673694685461,5.176036589385496,5.176036589385496,5.1538180240587765,5.130613309963919,5.096763810153481,5.077302079546483,5.027382880845547,4.986231016611832,4.9757866129301895,4.9757866129301895,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,4.965283045480287,5.03750652542484,5.057546630227358,5.139016473511566,5.171428327075375,5.208432658750867,5.254578390311568,5.3936872056725385,5.423298353568256,5.467493383863363,5.551171487272873,5.591263924940727,5.630854405790695,5.755898260165299,5.804832875800928,5.829341305658076,5.8638436596295564,5.985485097468286,5.998959791613207,6.045978508295942,6.056386459125701,6.066844645806295,6.11281019651697,0.212432020508742,0.448723344010721,0.49934672168012995,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.5162306706117479,0.43413588444936213,0.4114562434137021,0.34952119099006307,0.3189177007848045,0.2808377246212028,0.26299473168091936,0.1713791263895077,0.14324294881168687,0.11487660541689904,0.0958591471100132,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.0767718912697779,0.057628427477473876,0.009615088299702368,6.27338169970029,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.283185307179586],[6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263579976322381,6.263385914613194,6.263385914613194,6.263385914613194,6.263385914613194,6.263187973206436,0.01999733397315051,0.09157985014268566,0.1230859596950058,0.34788839127999527,0.49934672168012995,0.49934672168012995,0.5438324563021224,0.5743048301747017,0.6099169030770673,0.6837093116343712,0.9151007005533603,0.9203749132513717,0.9203749132513717,0.9203749132513717,0.9203749132513717,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9255770066340583,0.9324765187858507,0.9375864498705618,0.9495518162648359,0.9780989220598338,0.9780989220598338,0.9780989220598338,0.9780989220598338,0.9780989220598338,0.9851522094403642,1.0471975511965976],[0.9851522094403642,0.9851522094403642,0.9851522094403642,1.0067126057452396,1.0439917189558403,1.0990188156141465,1.148791296892679,1.2008902593383388,1.5300026439270311,1.5707963267948966,1.6745886672519394,1.7804361726691091,1.863239314246933,1.9151967288376937,1.9900287205487919,1.9990604796715514,2.0169018757383004,2.0257105333872762,2.0601893190227543,2.068618659411898,2.133294257863969,2.133294257863969,2.1382362762527456,2.1460119035301752,2.153709915750631,2.153709915750631,2.153709915750631,2.153709915750631,2.153709915750631,2.153709915750631,2.153709915750631,2.153709915750631,2.0943951023931953],[2.1763409903998667,2.1763409903998667,2.1995926132103296,2.393214606066275,2.393214606066275,2.479651012384285,2.534148055602145,2.599503705788355,2.677945044588987,2.7645050665764197,2.983265152781363,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,2.993915316541967,3.0020104096659144,3.0020104096659144,3.0020104096659144,3.0020104096659144,3.010123957902924,3.027338325628354,3.2764828158605925,3.313490384885485,3.3480670820154836,3.3659393241164413,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3708245868667888,3.3771376343106567,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.3834316096080936,3.1415926535897
