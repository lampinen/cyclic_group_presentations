"7295","125","True","In order for different numbers to be hit the second time around, there must be a remainder, in which case your number could not have fit neatly as a multiple or a divisor.",71
"7297","125","sometimes","Sometimes, because if N is even, then only odds will fit, the same is true for the opposite.",73
"7353","126","True","A multiple of a divisor of n will result in 0 before it results in all other possibilities and will thus always come to the same set of answers, e.g. 6(9)6(9)... will only result in 6, 3, 0; 8(12)8(12) will only result in 8, 4, 0; etc. ",71
"7355","126","sometimes","x moves forward the same amount each time it is used as a generator, but the inverse of x would essentially move backward the same amount each tim e. Eithe r way it eventually reaches all the answers.",73
"7411","127","True","I am not really sure how to explain it. This is diffi cult",71
"7413","127","sometimes","I think it should  actuall y be sometimes because we computed some expressions before where it wasn't true.",73
"7469","128","True","any number that can be divided evenly into n cannot be a generator, since you will always land on a divisor of n",71
"7471","128","sometimes","yes, because a generator will be able to hit every number in the scale",73
"7537","129","True","No. I believe it was that we can make every other number the number under it is  a genera tor.",91
"7539","129","sometimes","n/a",93
"7595","130","True","Because the only number that is the generator is the number just below the main number",71
"7597","130","sometimes","I don't know, I believe this has g one furt her than my math skills",73
"7653","131","True","I think it is correct because if x divides evenly into n then it would loop around again starting at 0. for instance, in checking if 3 is a generator of +_6 we start with 3+_6 3 = 0, 0+_6 3 = 3, 3+_6 3 = 0.",71
"7655","131","sometimes","becase 1 is always a generator of n so the inverse of 1 could by any other number in the range but not all the numbers in th e range  would be a generator.",73
"7711","132","True","If there is no remainder then every time you count x, you will land on the same numbers and won't be able to land on all numbers.",71
"7713","132","sometimes","There will always be a remainder.",73
"7769","133","True","Because if it divides evenly it will always hit the same numbers no matter how steps are taken and you want it to be able to hit new ones each time to be a generator.",71
"7771","133","sometimes","It just seems logical. Because the inverse would presumably also be evenly divisible into the same number?",73
"7827","134","True","Because in order to end up with an identity, you have to  be able  to reach the equivalent number.",71
"7829","134","sometimes","I'm stumped on this one.  I think it is part of the time depending whether the number is odd or even.",73
"7885","135","True","True. If x is a multiple of n then when you're subtracting n you're always going to end up with the same pattern of numbers and will never be able to generate all the numbers.",71
"7887","135","sometimes","Sometimes. It depends on whether the inverse is a multiple/divisor of n. ",73
"7943","136","True","When I did the problems to determine if  a numbe r was a generator or not I had both odd and even numbers come up as non-generators. The odd number though might have been a generator if I did many more trials, as it's pattern seemed weaker than the even numbers. So this *could* be true perhaps.",71
"7945","136","sometimes","Maybe. If I assume I was inco rrect an d 5 was a generator of +_9, the result of 5 +_9 5 is 1. I think 1 would always be a generator for +_n. ",73
"8001","137","True","This is true because a number that is not a generator will function this way.",71
"8003","137","Sometimes","It sometimes is a generator because it will occasionally work out that way, but other times it does not.",73
"8059","138","True","If x is not a divisor of n besides 1 each time you loop around the polygon you'll land on different spots.",71
"8061","138","Sometimes","Sometimes. It works for (3) but not for (4).",73
"8117","139","True","True because you need the variable X to equal +n",71
"8119","139","sometimes","False, it is not a generator because it would have to be equal to something other than X.",73
"8175","140","True","True. Because if it is a multiple, it will only generate other multiples and not all of the numbers. ",71
"8177","140","sometimes","I don't understand. I think, never. ",73
"8233","141","True","False. Just because it is multiple of a divisor doesn't necessarily mean it is a generator.",71
"8235","141","sometimes","Sometimes, if it's a lower number I think it can be a generator but the higher it gets it may no longer work as one.",73
"8291","142","True","True. If it's not a generator, x will take you evenly around the circle, stopping only at certain points. If you take any of those numbers and multiply it, you'd get a multiple of x.",71
"8293","142","Sometimes","I said sometimes because I don't know. I don't understand how to work with x and (n) in this ins tance.",73
"8349","143","True","I have no idea. I really think the generator portion could use better explanation. I think me getting lost at that point made all these future points very difficult to discern, and I usually am pretty good at algebraic equations.If I had to guess I would have to say no to this question only because I am thinking of the number 3 and it wouldn't work.",71
"8351","143","Sometimes","Again I really can't be certain. I would say it is never a generator because again when I think of 3 it doesn't work.",73
"8407","144","True","x can double then divide again?",71
"8409","144","Sometimes","x  is always the same",73
"8465","145","True","I think this is true because we must always end with a whole number when solving these equations.",71
"8467","145","sometimes","I have no idea. I'm going to guess sometimes. I don't understand how to determine this when I don't have any actual values for the numbers",73
"8523","146","True","false like if 3 was x and 9 was n- 3 can go into 9 3 times but with other numbers can be combined to make it to where 3 would make all the smaller numbers.",71
"8525","146","sometimes","No because then 9 could not be subtracted to make 0",73
"8581","147","True","Literally no idea what this is asking. I don't know if this is true or false so I don't know why its correct.",71
"8583","147","sometimes","I haven't taken a math class in almost 15 years. You haven't explained this concept!",73
"8639","148","True","True.  This would give an even number which are not generators",71
"8641","148","sometimes","That should equal an odd generator each time.",73
"8697","149","True","I wish I could. Im totally confused and worried about getting a rejection on this HIT now. ",71
"8699","149","sometimes","no idea. ",73
"8755","150","True","True, if x is not a generator than is must be a multiple of x and a divisor of n",71
"8757","150","sometimes","Sometimes? Depends on the number you are looking at.",73
"8823","151","True","false, for the 5 6 sided element for example, 2 was not a generator, 3 is a divisor of 6 and not a multiple of 2.",91
"8825","151","sometimes","5 is a generator in (9), if the element is (9), 5 will always be a generator. IF the element changes, 5 may or may not still be a generator. I apologize, I'm really trying hard here, math is not my strongest subject.",93
