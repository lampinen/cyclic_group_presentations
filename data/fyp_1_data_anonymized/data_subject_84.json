[{"nsides":6,"instructions":"Let's define a new operation <img src=\"./images/hexagon_symbol.png\" style=\"width:14px;height:14px\">. This operation will give us a way of combining two of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to get another one of them back. Consider the hexagon at the right, where I've labeled each point with one of the numbers. To perform <img src=\"./images/hexagon_symbol.png\" style=\"width:14px;height:14px\">, you can use the interactive diagram on the right, or perform the operation in your mind. or perform the operation in your mind. Point the arrow at the first number on the hexagon, then move the arrow the second number of points clockwise around the hexagon. The number the arrow arrives at is your result. (The operation is called <img src=\"./images/hexagon_symbol.png\" style=\"width:14px;height:14px\"> because it uses the hexagon, which has 6 sides.) <br /><br />For example, 3 <img src=\"./images/hexagon_symbol.png\" style=\"width:14px;height:14px\"> 5 = 2,  because  5 steps clockwise from 3 on the hexagon brings us to 2. So 3 <img src=\"./images/hexagon_symbol.png\" style=\"width:14px;height:14px\"> 5 = 2.<br /><br />Similarly, 1 <img src=\"./images/hexagon_symbol.png\" style=\"width:14px;height:14px\"> 4 = 5, because 4 steps clockwise from 1 brings us to 5. <br /><br />Click \"Continue\" when you are ready to move
