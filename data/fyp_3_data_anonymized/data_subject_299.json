By labeling the points of the nonagon with the numbers from 0 to 8, we ensure that when we combine two numbers under <img src=./images/nonagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>, we only produce numbers between 0 and 8. When we use the arithmetic strategy, adding the second number to the first mimics counting around the nonagon, and subtracting 9 each time we get above 8 makes sure the results correspond to the numbers on the points of the nonagon.<br /><br />We'll give you one practice question with feedback to make sure you understa nd the n ew operation.
