To perform <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>, you can use the interactive diagram on the right, or perform the operation in your mind. Point the arrow at the first number on the hexagon by clicking, then click (or click and drag) to move the arrow the second number of points clockwise around the hexagon. The number the arrow arrives at is your result. (The operation is called <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> because it uses the hexagon, which has 6 sides.) <br /><br />For example, 3 <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 5 =  2, becau se 5 steps clockwise from 3 on the hexagon brings us to 2.

For example, n could be 3, and the polygon a triangle, or n could be any other counting number you can think of. If you need to write the operation, you can use (n), and your answers can include n to stand in for the arbitrary value if necessary. (You can use the polygon at the right to think, but it doesn't necessarily correspond to the real polygon, which is why we've left most of it dashed.)","orientation_history":[0,[-6.268480484801735,-6.23818672488296,-6.191708593531957,-6.124326097688581,-6.035501245724632,-5.9037456705373215,-5.695039958646906,-5.519211171917062,-5.344442584270129,-5.294344553884153,-5.264413375530345,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.24333921253383,-5.1755152129989535,-5.08121167396383,-4.918177919373511,-4.714923829201368,-4.510255045563165,-4.307975586663972,-4.162729084220742,-3.9539285737079783,-3.7409068682198825,-3.601584714292117,-3.485658501482514,-3.4051874902170534,-3.3108312877491173,-3.184295945848741,-2.9251254868916545,-2.69088294885386,-2.3785097836884237,-2.1704038252175355,-1.9837435873493234,-1.9681544825120856,-1.9681544825120856,-1.9681544825120856,-1.9681544825120856,-1.9681544825120856,-1.9681544825120856,-1.9681544825120856,-1.9681544825120856,-1.9681544825120856,-0.8281014556563964,-0.7088254951552173,-0.6130382785396709,-0.5033637060788703,-0.2208401583430124,-6.04581954416537,-5.332710893397152,-4.770283611737333,-4.441875593391467,-4.1983374363267085,-4.038878121889362,-3.9298280546667925,-3.8328077500011837,-3.6717517466634852,-3.444154110733768,-2.9324077149968364,-2.4580756732758093,-2.155687791386063,-1.8861521168264792,-1.6958003787062088,-1.5002057025214448,-1.354774396042405,-1.1696539987526213,-0.9855087414212562,-0.8213412332997088,-0.6161565101470874,-0.28772446516303596,-0.009484007280985196,-5.936926322925797,-5.7720577313968535,-5.619079739441671,-5.407141685138392,-5.051842314863066,-4.766804638854021,-4.495921813686551,-4.31981282090902,-4.1767743771586225,-4.08163280017361,-3.9665804065176964,-3.816197279092023,-3.5948272593547594,-3.2851281556628207,-2.87907631447324,-2.6369305049582135,-2.4615984033814065,-2.2701822030292034,-2.0784949361335734,-1.7839485531341452,-1.5126406090255147,-1.350100167741214,-1.277791845411934,-1.22403203687416,-1.1488356563421984,-1.0735782093945687,-0.9613322469336927,-0.8684202483783157,-0.7484747756928787,-0.6549341232987871,-0.5438944929657108,-0.4997464906811766,-0.44894278662295495,-0.44894278662295495,-0.4119226707490249,-0.4119226707490249,-0.4119226707490249,-0.4119226707490249,-0.4119226707490249,-0.4119226707490249,-0.4119226707490249]],"rt":17538,"trial_type":"polygon-arrow-instructions","trial_index":0,"trial_index_global":65,"time_elapsed":960372,"internal_chunk_id":"0-0"},{"nsides":"n","question":"What is the formula for the inverse of 1 under <img src=./images/ngon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>?","response_type":"free","response_choices":[],"correct_response":"n-1","response":"Inverse of 1 = value of n - 1.
