By labeling the points of the nonagon with the numbers from 0 to 8, we ensure that when we combine two numbers under <img src=./images/nonagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>, we only produce numbers between 0 and 8. When we use the arithmetic strategy, adding the second number to the first mimics counting around the nonagon, and subtracting 9 each time we get above 8 makes sure the results correspond to the numbers on the points of the nonagon.<br /><br />We'll give you one practice question with feedback to make sure you understand the new operation. After that, try to complete the remaining questions as accurately as possible.","orientation_history":[0],"rt":1945,"trial_type":"polygon-arrow-instructions","trial_index":0,"trial_index_global":65,"time_elapsed":720216,"internal_chunk_id":" 0-0"},{"nsides":9,"question":"Practice: What is 5 <img src=./images/nonagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 5?","response_type":"free","response_choices":[],"correct_response":"1","response":"0","explain":false,"explanation":"","explanation_history":[],"orientation_history":[[0]],"response_history":["0"],"rt":9620,"trial_type":"polygon-arrow-question","trial_index":0,"trial_index_global":66,"time_elapsed":729836,"internal_chunk_id":"0-0.12-0"},{"nsides":9,"feedback":"Sorry, that was incorrect. 5 <img src=./images/nonagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 5 = 1 because 5 steps clockwise on the nonagon from 5 brings us to 1.
