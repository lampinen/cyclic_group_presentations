[{"nsides":6,"instructions":"Let's define a new operation <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>. This operation will give us a way of combining two of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to get another one of them back. To perform <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px>, you can either use a method based on the hexagon at right, or a method based on arithmetic.<br /><b>Hexagon method:</b> you can use the interactive diagram on the right, or perform the operation in your mind. Point the arrow at the first number on the hexagon by clicking, then click (or click and drag) to move the arrow the second number of points clockwise around the hexagon. The number the arrow arrives at is your result. (The operation is called <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> because it uses the hexagon, which has 6 sides.) <br ><b>Arithmetic method:</b> you start with the first number, and then add  the sec ond one to it. If the sum is smaller than 6, that's your result. If the sum is 6 or bigger, you subtract 6 to get your result. <br /><br />For example, 3 <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 5 = 2, because 5 steps clockwise from 3 on the hexagon brings us to 2. Equivalently, 3 + 5 = 8, and 8 is bigger than 6, so we subtract 6, and 8 - 6 = 2. So 3 <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 5 = 2.<br /><br />Similarly, 1 <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> 4 = 5, because 1 + 4 = 5, and 5 is less than 6 so we leave it alone. Equivalently, 4 steps clockwise from 1 on the hexagon brings us to 5. <br /><br />Click Continue when you're ready to move

you see how the different ways of performing <img src=./images/hexagon_symbol.png style=width:14px;height:14px> give the same result? By labeling the points of the hexagon with the numbers from 0 to 5, we ensure that when we combine two numbers using the hexagon, we only produce numbers between 0 and 5. When we use the arithmetic strategy, adding the second number to the first mimics counting around the hexagon, and subtracting 6 each time we get above 5 makes sure the results correspond to the numbers on the points of the hexagon. <br /><br />Click Continue when you're ready to move on.","orientation_history":[0],"rt":28089,"trial_type":"polygon-arrow-instructions","trial_index":0,"trial_index_global":2,"time_elapsed":212046,"internal_chunk_id":"0-0"},{"nsides":6,"question":"Now  try one  on your own!
