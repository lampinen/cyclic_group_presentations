abstract = {Infants can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar grammatical patterns expressed in a vocabulary that is distinct from that used earlier during familiarization (Cognition 70(2) (1999) 109; Science 283 (1999) 77). Various models have captured the data, although each required that discrimination be distinct, in terms of the computational process, from familiarization. This article describes a simple recurrent network (SRN), equipped only with the assumption that it should predict what comes next, which models the data without distinguishing between familiarization and discrimination. To accomplish this, the SRN requires pre-training on a range of sequences instantiating different structures and different vocabulary items to those used subsequently during familiarization and test. Pre-training enables the network to avoid replacing structure acquired during familiarization with structure experienced at test. An equivalent enabling condition may underpin infants' resistance to catastrophic interference between the different structures and vocabulary items to which they are exposed.

abstract = {Multi-voxel pattern recognition techniques combined with Hidden Markov models can be used to discover the mental states that people go through in performing a task. The combined method identifies both the mental states and how their durations vary with experimental conditions. We apply this method to a task where participants solve novel mathematical problems. We identify four states in the solution of these problems: Encoding, Planning, Solving, and Respond. The method allows us to interpret what participants are doing on individual problem-solving trials. The duration of the planning state varies on a trial-to-trial basis with novelty of the problem. The duration of solution stage similarly varies with the amount of computation needed to produce a solution once a plan is devised. The response stage similarly varies with the complexity of the answer produced. In addition, we identified a number of effects that ran counter to a prior model of the task. Thus, we were able to decompose the overall problem-solving time into estimates of its components and in way that serves to guide theory.},

Worked-examples research is a cognitive-experimental program that has relevance to classroom in- struction and the broader educational research community. A frame- work for organizing the findings of this research is proposed, leading to instructional design principles. For instance, one instructional de- sign principle suggests that effective examples have highly integrated components. They employ multiple modalities in presentation and em- phasize conceptual structure by labeling or segmenting. At the lesson level, effective instruction employs multiple examples for each concep- tual problem type, varies example formats within problem type, and employs surface features to signal deep structure. Also, examples should be presented in close proximity to matched practice problems. More- over, learners can be encouraged through direct training or by the structure of the worked example to actively self-explain examples. Worked examples are associated with early stages of skill develop- ment, but the design principles are relevant to constructivist research and teaching. The},

The authors argue the reason for this confusion is a failure to specify various dimensions along which transfer can occur, resulting in comparisons of "apples and oranges." They provide a framework that describes 9 relevant dimensions and show that the literature can productively be classified along these dimensions, with each study situated at the intersection of various dimensions. Estimation of a single effect size for far transfer is misguided in view of this complexity. The past 100 years of research shows that evidence for transfer under some conditions is substantial, but critical conditions for many key questions are untested.},

Here, we formal- ize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them “curricu- lum learning”. In the context of recent re- search studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neu- ral networks), we explore curriculum learn- ing in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generaliza- tion can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).},

It suggests that an examination of the executive cognitive demand of mathematical thinking can complement procedural and conceptual knowledge-based approaches to understanding the ways in which children become profi cient in mathematics. Task analysis indicates that executive cognitive functions likely operate in concert with procedural and conceptual knowledge and in some instances might act as a unique infl uence on mathematics problem-solving ability. It is concluded that consideration of the executive cognitive demand of mathematics can contribute to research on best practices in mathematics education.},

The students' behavior on the tasks was consistent with the van Hieles' original general description of the levels, although the discreteness of levels, particularly of analysis and abstraction, was not confirmed. The use of formal deduction among students who were taking or had taken secondary school geometry was nearly absent, consistent with earlier observations by Usiskin (1982).},

In this investigation, 2- to 5-year-old childrens recall of injuries requiring hospital emergency room treatment was assessed within a few days of the injury and again 2 years later, along with the way their parents reminisced with them about the event. Correlational analyses showed that age and parental reminiscing style were consistently related to child memory; regression analyses showed that although age was most important, parents who were more elaborative had children who recalled more during their initial interview about the harder- to-remember hospital event.

abstract = {Most studies investigating mental numerical processing involve adult participants and little is known about the functioning of these systems in children. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of numeracy and the influence of age on these correlates with a group of adults and a group of third graders who had average to above average mathematical ability. Participants performed simple and complex versions of exact and approximate calculation tasks while in the magnet. Like adults, children activated a network of brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes during the calculation tasks, and they recruited additional brain regions for the more complex versions of the tasks. However, direct comparisons between adults and children revealed significant differences in level of activation across all tasks. In particular, patterns of activation in the parietal lobe were significantly different as a function of age. Findings support previous claims that the parietal lobe becomes more specialized for arithmetic tasks with age.},

abstract = {Most studies on mathematics learning in the field of educational neuroscience have focused on the neural correlates of very elementary numerical processing skills in children. Little is known about more complex mathematical skills that are formally taught in school, such as arithmetic. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study investigated how brain activation during single-digit addition and subtraction is modulated by problem size and arithmetic operation in 28 children aged 10-12. years with different levels of arithmetical fluency. Commensurate with adult data, large problems and subtractions activated a fronto-parietal network, including the intraparietal sulci, the latter of which indicates the influence of quantity-based processes during procedural strategy execution. Different from adults, the present findings revealed that particularly the left hippocampus was active during the solution of those problems that are expected to be solved by means of fact retrieval (i.e. small problems and addition), suggesting a specific role of the hippocampus in the early stages of learning arithmetic facts. Children with low levels of arithmetical fluency showed higher activation in the right intraparietal sulcus during the solution of problems with a relatively small problem size, indicating that they continued to rely to a greater extent on quantity-based strategies on those problems that the children with relatively higher arithmetical fluency already retrieved from memory. This might represent a neural correlate of fact retrieval impairments in children with mathematical difficulties. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Many studies tested the association between numerical magnitude processing and mathematics achievement, results differ depending on the number format used. For symbolic numbers (digits), data are consistent and robust across studies and populations: weak performance correlates with low math achievement and dyscalculia. For non-symbolic formats (dots), many conflicting findings have been reported. These inconsistencies might be explained by methodological issues. Alternatively, it might be that the processes measured by non-symbolic tasks are not critical for school-relevant mathematics. A few neuroimaging studies revealed that brain activation during number comparison correlates with the children’s mathematics achievement level, but the consistency of such relationships for symbolic and non-symbolic processing is unclear. These neurocognitive data provide ground for educational interventions, which seem to have positive effects on children's numerical development in (a)typical populations.},

abstract = {Does the human capacity for mathematical intuition depend on linguistic competence or on visuo-spatial representations? A series of behavioral and brain-imaging experiments provides evidence for both sources. Exact arithmetic is acquired in a language-specific format, transfers poorly to a different language or to novel facts, and recruits networks involved in word-association processes. In contrast, approximate arithmetic shows language independence, relies on a sense of numerical magnitudes, and recruits bilateral areas of the parietal lobes involved in visuo-spatial processing. Mathematical intuition may emerge from the interplay of these brain systems.},

abstract = {Did evolution endow the human brain with a predisposition to represent and acquire knowledge about numbers? Although the parietal lobe has been suggested as a potential substrate for a domain-specific representation of quantities, it is also engaged in verbal, spatial, and attentional functions that may contribute to calculation. To clarify the organisation of number-related processes in the parietal lobe, we examine the three-dimensional intersection of fMRI activations during various numerical tasks, and also review the corresponding neuropsychological evidence. On this basis, we propose a tentative tripartite organisation. The horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS) appears as a plausible candidate for domain specificity: It is systematically activated whenever numbers are manipulated, independently of number notation, and with increasing activation as the task puts greater emphasis on quantity processing. Depending on task demands, we speculate that this core quantity system, analogous to an internal "number line," can be supplemented by two other circuits. A left angular gyrus area, in connection with other left-hemispheric perisylvian areas, supports the manipulation of numbers in verbal form. Finally, a bilateral posterior superior parietal system supports attentional orientation on the mental number line, just like on any other spatial dimension.},

abstract = {Skill theory provides tools for predicting developmental sequences and synchronies in any domain at any point in development by integrating behavioral and cognitive-developmental concepts. Cognitive development is explained by skill structures called "levels," together with transformation rules relating these levels to each other. The transformation rules specify the developmental steps by which a skill moves gradually from one level of complexity to the next. At every step in these developmental sequences, the individual controls a particular skill. Skills are gradually transformed from sensory-motor actions to representations and then to abstractions. The transformations produce continuous behavioral changes; but across the entire profile of a person's skills and within highly practiced task domains, a stagelike shift in skills occurs as the person develops to an optimal level. The theory suggests a common framework for integrating developmental analyses of cognitive, social, language, and perceptual-motor skills and certain behavioral changes in learning and problem solving.

Apolog{\'{\i}}a de S{\'{o}}crates. Men{\'{o}}n. Cr{\'{a}}tilo. Madrid: Alianza Editorial]. Socrates asked Meno's slave 50 questions requiring simple additions or multiplications. At the end of the lesson the student discovered by himself how to duplicate a square using the diagonal of the given one as the side of the new square. We studied empirically the reproducibility of this dialogue in educated adults and adolescents of the 21st century. Our results show a remarkable agreement between Socratic and empiric dialogues. Even in questions in which Meno's slave made a mistake, within an unbounded number of possible erred responses, the vast majority of participants produced the same error as Meno's slave. Our results show that the Socratic dialogue is built on a strong intuition of human knowledge and reasoning which persists more than 24 centuries after its conception, providing one of the most striking demonstrations of universality across time and cultures. At the same time, they also emphasize its educational failure. After following every single question including Socrates' "diagonal argument," almost 50{\%} of the participants failed to learn the simplest generalization when asked to double the area of a square of different size. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Cognitive science aims to reverse-engineer the mind, and many of the engineering challenges the mind faces involve inductive inference. The probabilistic approach to modeling cognition begins with the goal of understanding these inductive problems in computational terms: what makes them difficult, and how they can be solved in principle. Mental processes are then modeled using algorithms for approximately implementing these ideal solutions, and neural processes are viewed as mechanisms for implementing these algorithms in biological hardware. This top-down approach is analogous to historical progressions of theory building in other natural sciences, moving from macro-level functional explanations of observable phenomena to micro-level mechanistic accounts. Typical connectionist models, by contrast, follow a bottom-up approach, starting from an abstract characterization of neural mechanisms and exploring what macro-level functional phenomena might emerge from those mechanisms. We suggest that the top-down approach is likely to yield more rapid progress towards understanding human inductive inference.},

The IQs of the 140 children (75 girls and 65 boys) retained in the study group (three were excluded because of low IQs) ranged from 80 to 129 (mean 98.2, SD 9.9). 26 per cent of the children had symptoms of ADHD, and 17 per cent had dyslexia. Their socio-economic status was significantly lower than that of the rest of the cohort, and 42 per cent had first-degree relatives with learning disabilities. The prevalence of dyscalculia in the original cohort was 6.5 per cent, similar to that of dyslexia and ADHD. However, unlike these other learning disabilities, dyscalculia affected the two sexes in about the same proportions.},

abstract = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine brain areas involved in simple arithmetic, and to compare these areas between adults and children. Eight children (four girls and four boys; age, 9-14 years) and eight adults (four women and four men; age, 40-49 years) were subjected to this study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed during mental calculation of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of single digits. In each group, the left middle frontal, bilateral inferior temporal and bilateral lateral occipital cortices were activated during each task. The adult group showed activation of the right frontal cortex during addition and multiplication tasks, but the children group did not. Activation of the intraparietal cortex was observed in the adult group during each task. Although, activation patterns were slightly different among tasks, as well as between groups, only a small number of areas showed statistically significant differences. The results indicate that cortical networks involved in simple arithmetic are similar among arithmetic operations, and may not show significant changes in the structure during the second decade of life. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Bayesian models of cognition hypothesize that human brains make sense of data by representing prob-ability distributions and applying Bayes' rule to find the best explanation for any given data. Under-standing the neural mechanisms underlying probabilistic models remains important because Bayesian models essentially provide a computational framework, rather than specifying processes at the algo-rithmic level. Here, we propose a constructive neural-network model which estimates and represents probability distributions from observable events — a phenomenon related to the concept of proba-bility matching. We use a form of operant learning, where the underlying probabilities are learned from positive and negative reinforcements of inputs. Our model is psychologically plausible because, similar to humans, it learns to represent probabilities without receiving any representation of them from the external world, but rather by experiencing individual events. Moreover, we show that our neural implementation of probability matching can be paired with a neural module applying Bayes' rule, forming a comprehensive neural scheme to simulate human Bayesian learning and inference. Our model also provides novel explanations of several deviations from Bayes, including base-rate neglect and overweighting of rare events.},

abstract = {We present a new model of skilled performance in geometry proof problem solving called the Diagram Configuration model (DC). While previous models plan proofs in a step-by-step fashion, we observed that experts plan at a more abstract level: They focus on the key steps and skip the less important ones. DC models this abstract planning behavior by parsing geometry problem diagrams into perceptual chunks, called diagram configurations, which cue relevant schematic knowledge. We provide verbal protocol evidence that DC's schemas correspond with the step-skipping inferences experts make in their initial planning. We compare DC with other models of geometry expertise and then, in the final section, we discuss more general implications of our research. DC's reasoning has important similarities with Larkin's (1988) display-based reasoning approach and Johnson-Laird's (1983) mental model approach. DC's perceptually based schemas are a step towards a unified explanation of (1) experts' superior problem-solving effectiveness, (2) experts' superior problem-state memory, and (3) experts' ability, in certain domains, to solve relatively simple problems by pure forward inferencing. We also argue that the particular and efficient knowledge organization of DC challenges current theories of skill acquisition as it presents an end-state of learning that is difficult to explain within such theories. Finally, we discuss the implications of DC for geometry instruction. © 1990.},

We used fMRI to test the hypotheses that there are specific neural networks dedicated to performing an arithmetic operation (e.g. + or -) and to performing processes that support more complex calculations. We found that the right inferior parietal lobule, left precuneus and left superior parietal gyrus are relatively specific for performing subtraction; and bilateral medial frontal/cingulate cortex are relatively specific for supporting arithmetic procedure complexity. We also found that greater difficulty level was associated with activation in a brain network including left inferior intraparietal sulcus, left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral cingulate.

Some forms of the problem take 16 times as long to solve, on average, as other versions. Since isomorphism rules out size of task domain as a determinant of relative difficulty, these experiments seek and find causes for the differences in features of the problem representation. Analysis of verbal protocols and the temporal patterning of moves allows the problem-solving behavior to be divided into exploratory and final-path phases. Entry into the final-path phase depends on acquisition of the ability to plan pairs of moves, an achievement made difficult by the working memory load it entails. This memory load can be reduced by automating the rules governing moves, either through problem exploration or training. Once automation has occurred, the solution is obtained very rapidly. Memory load is also proposed as the locus of other differences in difficulty found between various problem representations. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging findings in adults suggest exact and approximate number processing relying on distinct neural circuits. In the present study we are investigating whether this cortical specialization is already established in 9- and 12-year-old children. Using fMRI, brain activation was measured in 10 third- and 10 sixth-grade school children and 20 adults during trials of symbolic approximate (AP) and exact (EX) calculation, as well as non-symbolic magnitude comparison (MC) of objects. Children activated similar networks like adults, denoting an availability and a similar spatial extent of specified networks as early as third grade. However, brain areas related to number processing become further specialized with schooling. Children showed weaker activation in the intraparietal sulcus during all three tasks, in the left inferior frontal gyrus during EX and in occipital areas during MC. In contrast, activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus, a region associated with attentional effort and working memory load, was enhanced in children. Moreover, children revealed reduced or absent deactivation of regions involved in the so-called default network during symbolic calculation, suggesting a rather general developmental effect. No difference in brain activation patterns between AP and EX was found. Behavioral results indicated major differences between children and adults in AP and EX, but not in MC. Reaction time and accuracy rate were not correlated to brain activation in regions showing developmental changes suggesting rather effects of development than performance differences between children and adults. In conclusion, increasing expertise with age may lead to more automated processing of mental arithmetic, which is reflected by improved performance and by increased brain activation in regions related to number processing and decreased activation in supporting areas.},

We expose a fundamental, but neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971; McClelland, McNaughton, {\&} O'Reilly, 1995), and empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible relational memory (Cohen {\&} Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme envisioned by complementary learning systems theory (McClelland et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization-as long as there is recurrence rather than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity computation, a process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support generalization through interactions that unfold within a dynamically created memory space.},

abstract = {People can test hypotheses through either selection or reception. In a selection task, the learner actively chooses observations to test his or her beliefs, whereas in reception tasks data are passively encountered. People routinely use both forms of testing in everyday life, but the critical psychological differences between selection and reception learning remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that selection learning improves learning performance by enhancing generic cognitive processes related to motivation, attention, and engagement. Alternatively, we suggest that differences between these 2 learning modes derives from a hypothesis-dependent sampling bias that is introduced when a person collects data to test his or her own individual hypothesis. Drawing on influential models of sequential hypothesis-testing behavior, we show that such a bias (a) can lead to the collection of data that facilitates learning compared with reception learning and (b) can be more effective than observing the selections of another person. We then report a novel experiment based on a popular category learning paradigm that compares reception and selection learning. We additionally compare selection learners to a set of "yoked" participants who viewed the exact same sequence of observations under reception conditions. The results revealed systematic differences in performance that depended on the learner's role in collecting information and the abstract structure of the problem.},

@article{McClelland2013,
abstract = {The complementary learning systems theory of the roles of hippocampus and neocortex (McClelland, McNaughton, {\&} O'Reilly, 1995) holds that the rapid integration of arbitrary new information into neocortical structures is avoided to prevent catastrophic interference with structured knowledge representations stored in synaptic connections among neocortical neurons. Recent studies (Tse et al., 2007, 2011) showed that neocortical circuits can rapidly acquire new associations that are consistent with prior knowledge. The findings challenge the complementary learning systems theory as previously presented. However, new simulations extending those reported in McClelland et al. (1995) show that new information that is consistent with knowledge previously acquired by a putatively cortexlike artificial neural network can be learned rapidly and without interfering with existing knowledge; it is when inconsistent new knowledge is acquired quickly that catastrophic interference ensues. Several important features of the findings of Tse et al. (2007, 2011) are captured in these simulations, indicating that the neural network model used in McClelland et al. has characteristics in common with neocortical learning mechanisms. An additional simulation generalizes beyond the network model previously used, showing how the rate of change of cortical connections can depend on prior knowledge in an arguably more biologically plausible network architecture. In sum, the findings of Tse et al. are fully consistent with the idea that hippocampus and neocortex are complementary learning systems. Taken together, these findings and the simulations reported here advance our knowledge by bringing out the role of consistency of new experience with existing knowledge and demonstrating that the rate of change of connections in real and artificial neural networks can be strongly prior-knowledge dependent.},

Symbols and processes that operate on them are often seen today as approximate characterizations of the emergent consequences of sub- or nonsymbolic processes, and a wide range of constructs in cognitive science can be understood as emergents. These include representational constructs (units, structures, rules), architectural constructs (central execu- tive, declarative memory), and developmental processes and outcomes (stages, sensitive periods, neurocognitive modules, developmental disorders). The greatest achievements of human cognition may be largely emergent phenomena.

abstract = {A method has been developed for measuring the rate of phagocytosis rather than the quantity of particles ingested per cell when the process is virtually complete. The method, which is simpler and more rapid than those described previously, utilizes cellular monolayers, radioactive particles, and short incubation times. Under the conditions described, the rate of uptake of particles by either guinea-pig peritoneal or human blood leukocytes was proportional to both cell concentration and the time of incubation, and was independent of changes in the concentration of particles during the measurement. The particles were retained by the cells for at least 90 min. The most suitable particles so far used have been (32)P-labeled Salmonella typhimurium, and acetyl-(14)C- or methyl-(14)C-labeled starch particles. The oxidation of (14)C-labeled glucose has been studied under the same conditions that were used for the assays of phagocytosis: the greatest increase in formation of (14)CO(2) from glucose-1-(14)C occurred a few minutes after the most rapid period of phagocytosis.},

abstract = {Generalizations about neural function are often drawn from non-human animal models to human cognition, however, the assumption of cross-species conservation may sometimes be invalid. Humans may use different strategies mediated by alternative structures, or similar structures may operate differently within the context of the human brain. The transitive inference problem, considered a hallmark of logical reasoning, can be solved by non-human species via associative learning rather than logic. We tested whether humans use similar strategies to other species for transitive inference. Results are crucial for evaluating the validity of widely accepted assumptions of similar neural substrates underlying performance in humans and other animals. Here we show that successful transitive inference in humans is unrelated to use of associative learning strategies and is associated with ability to report the hierarchical relationship among stimuli. Our work stipulates that cross-species generalizations must be interpreted cautiously, since performance on the same task may be mediated by different strategies and/or neural systems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this article we present symmetric diffusion networks, a family of networks that instantiate the principles of continuous, stochastic, adaptive and interactive propagation of information.  Using methods from Markovian diffusion theory, we formalize the activation dynamics of these networks and then show that they can be trained to reproduce entire multivariate probability distributions on their outputs using the contrastive Hebbian learning rule (CHL).  We show that CHL performs gradient descent on an error function that captures differences between desired and obtained continuous multivariate probability distributions.  This allows the learning algorithm to go beyond expected values of output units and to approximate complete probability distributions on continuous multivariate activation spaces.  We argue that learning continuous distributions is an important task underlying a variety of real life situations which were beyond the scope of previous connectionist networks.  Deterministic networks, like back propagation, cannot learn the task because they are limited to learning average values of independent output units.  Previous stochastic connectionist networks could learn probability distribtions but they were limited to discrete variables.  Simulations show that symmetric diffustion networks can be trained with the CHL rule to approximate discrete and continuous probability distributions of various types.},

Embodied cognition is an emerging framework for under- standing intellectual behaviour in relation to the physical and social environment and to the perception- and action-based systems of the body. By reconsidering cognition with regard to interactions with the world, rather than in terms of the sequestered computa- tional nature of the mind, embodied cognition recasts many of the central issues of the study of thought and behaviour. One of the ways that cognition is seen as embodied is through the close relation of hand gestures with thinking and communication.

I identify the prevalence of FF in curriculum and instruction and outline some of the serious problems engendered by FF approaches.

abstract = {The term “learning styles” refers to the concept that individuals differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech) and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment instruments are extremely diverse. The most common—but not the only—hypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner (e.g., for a “visual learner,” emphasizing visual presentation of information).The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and many organizations offer professional development workshops for teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles.The authors of the present review were charged with determining whether these practices are supported by scientific evidence. We concluded that any credible validation of learning-styles-based instruction requires robust documentation of a very particular type of experimental finding with several necessary criteria. First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all. Further research on the use of learning styles assessment in instruction may in some cases be warranted, but such research needs to be performed appropriately.},

With positron emission tomography (PET), we investigated the neural bases of the cognitive abilities of an expert calculator and a group of non-experts, contrasting complex mental calculation to memory retrieval of arithmetic facts. We demonstrated that calculation expertise was not due to increased activity of processes that exist in non-experts; rather, the expert and the non-experts used different brain areas for calculation. We found that the expert could switch between short-term effort-requiring storage strategies and highly efficient episodic memory encoding and retrieval, a process that was sustained by right prefrontal and medial temporal areas.},

abstract = {Knowledge tracing—where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they interact with coursework—is a well established problem in computer supported education. Though effectively modeling student knowledge would have high ed-ucational impact, the task has many inherent challenges. In this paper we explore the utility of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model student learning. The RNN family of models have important advantages over previous methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge. Using neu-ral networks results in substantial improvements in prediction performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned model can be used for intelligent curriculum design and allows straightforward interpretation and dis-covery of structure in student tasks. These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing and an exemplary application task for RNNs.},

Participants solved 3 types of problems: 2-operation problems requiring mathematical reasoning and text processing, 1-operation problems requiring text processing but minimal mathematical reasoning, and 0-operation problems requiring minimal text processing and controlling sensorimotor demands of the NAOT problems. Two-operation problems yielded major activations in bilateral frontal regions similar to those found in other problem-solving tasks, indicating that the processes mediated by these regions subserve many forms of reasoning. Findings suggest a dissociation in mathematical problem solving between reasoning, mediated by frontal cortex, and text processing, mediated by temporal cortex.},

As with adults, practice in symbol manipulation produces a reduced activation in prefrontal cortex area. However, unlike adults, practice seems also to produce a decrease in a parietal area that is holding an image of the equation. This finding suggests that adolescents' brain responses are more plastic and change more with practice.

But in separating the wheat from the pseudoscientific chaff in learning-styles theory, we will make clear that the wheat is contained in other educational approaches as well. A belief in learning styles is not necessary to incorporating useful knowledge about learning into one's teaching. We will then discuss the reasons why learning styles beliefs are so prevalent. Finally, we will offer suggestions about collegiate pedagogy, given that we have no evidence learning styles do not exist.},

In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the associationbetween nickel sensitization and exposure to orthodontic appliances and piercings. 4376adolescents were patch tested following a questionnaire asking for earlier piercing andorthodontic treatment. Exposure to orthodontic appliances was verified in dental records.Results. Questionnaire data demonstrated a reduced risk of nickel sensitization whenorthodontic treatment preceded piercing (OR 0.46; CI 0.27–0.78). Data from dentalrecords demonstrated similar results (OR 0.61, CI 0.36–1.02), but statistical significancewas lost when adjusting for background factors. Exposure to full, fixed applianceswith NiTi-containing alloys (OR 0.31, CI 0.10–0.98) as well as a pooled ‘high nickel-releasing’ appliance group (OR 0.56, CI 0.32–0.97) prior to piercing was associated witha significantly reduced risk of nickel sensitization.Conclusion. High nickel-containing orthodontic appliances preceding piercingreduces the risk of nickel sensitization by a factor 1.5–2. The risk reduction is associatedwith estimated nickel release of the appliance and length of treatment. Sex, age at piercingand number of piercings are also important risk indicators. Research on the role of dentalmaterials in the development of immunological tolerance is needed.},

abstract = {Means–ends analysis is a mechanism that is assumed to operate when people solve transformation problems. Its use is affected by the extent to which the goal is clearly specified to the problem solver as a problem state and by the extent to which learning occurs during a problem-solving episode. Five maze-tracing experiments were conducted with 116 undergraduates in which the finish point of the maze could be presented either as a specific location or in more general terms. The latter prevented the use of conventional means–ends analysis. Results indicate that on the particular maze configuration used, the nonspecific goal resulted in fewer errors and more rapid learning of the structure of the problem. Under conditions that facilitated the use of means–ends analyses, knowledge of the goal location rendered the problem insoluble. General results were replicated with the use of numerical problems. Implications for the generality of means–ends analysis as a problem-solving mechanism are discussed. (11 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

abstract = {Background: There is increasing interest in applying neuroscience findings to topics in education. Purpose: This application requires a proper conceptualisation of the relation between cognition and brain function. This paper considers two such conceptualisations. The area focus understands each cognitive competency as the product of one (and only one) brain area. The network focus explains each cognitive competency as the product of collaborative processing among multiple brain areas. Sources of evidence: We first review neuroscience studies of mathematical reasoning–specifically arithmetic problem-solving and magnitude comparison–that exemplify the area focus and network focus. We then review neuroscience findings that illustrate the potential of the network focus for informing three topics in mathematics education: the development of mathematical reasoning, the effects of practice and instruction, and the derailment of mathematical reasoning in dyscalculia. Main argument: Although the area focus has historically dominated discussions in educational neuroscience, we argue that the network focus offers a complementary perspective on brain function that should not be ignored. Conclusions: We conclude by describing the current limitations of network-focus theorising and emerging neuroscience methods that promise to make such theorising more tractable in the future.},

abstract = {The ability to construct proofs is an important skill for all mathematicians. Despite its importance, students have great difficulty with this task. In this paper, I first demonstrate that undergraduates often are aware of and able to apply the facts required to prove a statement but still fail to prove it. They thus fail to construct a proof because they could not use the syntactic knowledge that they had. By comparing doctoral students and undergraduates constructing proofs in abstract algebra, I have hypothesized four types of `strategic knowledge' – knowledge of how to choose which facts and theorems to apply – which the doctoral students appeared to possess and undergraduates did not. The doctoral students appeared to know the powerful proof techniques in abstract algebra, which theorems are most important, when particular facts and theorems are likely to be useful, and when one should or should not try and prove theorems using symbol manipulation.},

@article{Weber2004,
abstract = {It is widely accepted by mathematics educators and mathematicians that most proof-oriented university mathematics courses are taught in a "definition-theorem-proof" format. However, there are relatively few empirical studies on what takes place during this instruction, why this instruction is used, and how it affects students' learning. In this paper, I investigate these issues by examining a case study of one professor using this type of instruction in an introductory real analysis course. I first describe the professor's actions in the classroom and argue that these actions are the result of the professor's beliefs about mathematics, students, and education, as well as his knowledge of the material being covered. I then illustrate how the professor's teaching style influenced the way that his students attempted to learn the material. Finally, I discuss the implications that the reported data have on mathematics education research. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Formal Concept Analysis has been originally developed as a subfield of Applied Mathematics based on the mathematization of concept and concept hierarchy. Only after more than a decade of development, the connections to the philosophical logic of human thought became clearer and even later the connections to Piaget’s cognitive structuralism which Thomas Bernhard Seiler convincingly elaborated to a comprehensive theory of concepts in his recent book [Se01]. It is the main concern of this paper to show the surprisingly rich correspondences between Seiler’s multifarious aspects of concepts in the human mind and the structural properties and relationships of formal concepts in Formal Concept Analysis. These correspondences make understandable, what has been experienced in a great multitude of applications, that Formal Concept Analysis may function in the sense of transdisciplinary mathematics, i.e., it allows mathematical thought to aggregate with other ways of thinking and thereby to support human thought and action.},

These are not differences of ability but rather preferences for processing certain types of information or for processing information in certain types of way. If accurate, learning styles theories could have important implications for instruction because student achievement would be a product of the interaction of instruction and the student’s style. There is reason to think that people view learning styles theories as broadly accurate, but, in fact, scientific support for these theories is lacking. We suggest that educators’ time and energy are better spent on other theories that might aid instruction. Keywords},

abstract = {This article proposes a theoretical framework for external representation based problem solving. The Tic-Tat-Toe and its isomorphs are used to illustrate the procedures of the framework as a methodology and test the predictions of the framework as a functional model. Experimental results show that the behavior in the Tic-Tat-Toe is determined by the directly available information in external and internal representations in terms of perceptual and cognitive biases, regardless of whether the biases are consistent with, inconsistent with, or irrelevant to the task. It is shown that external representations are not merely inputs and stimuli to the internal mind and that they have much more important functions than mere memory aids. A representational determinism is suggested-the form of a representation determines what information can be perceived, what processes can be activated, and what structures can be discovered from the specific representation.},

In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the associationbetween nickel sensitization and exposure to orthodontic appliances and piercings. 4376adolescents were patch tested following a questionnaire asking for earlier piercing andorthodontic treatment. Exposure to orthodontic appliances was verified in dental records.Results. Questionnaire data demonstrated a reduced risk of nickel sensitization whenorthodontic treatment preceded piercing (OR 0.46; CI 0.27–0.78). Data from dentalrecords demonstrated similar results (OR 0.61, CI 0.36–1.02), but statistical significancewas lost when adjusting for background factors. Exposure to full, fixed applianceswith NiTi-containing alloys (OR 0.31, CI 0.10–0.98) as well as a pooled ‘high nickel-releasing’ appliance group (OR 0.56, CI 0.32–0.97) prior to piercing was associated witha significantly reduced risk of nickel sensitization.Conclusion. High nickel-containing orthodontic appliances preceding piercingreduces the risk of nickel sensitization by a factor 1.5–2. The risk reduction is associatedwith estimated nickel release of the appliance and length of treatment. Sex, age at piercingand number of piercings are also important risk indicators. Research on the role of dentalmaterials in the development of immunological tolerance is needed.},
