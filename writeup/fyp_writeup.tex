\section{Introduction}
What is the purpose of a pedagogical presentation of a mathematical concept? As the word ``presentation'' suggests, they are generally used to represent a broader concept, category, or idea. However, usually the presentation will not be perfectly representative, that is, only some of its features will be category-general. In addition, students may have some preconceptions about the objects included in the presentation. Both of these factors may bias their inferences. Thus changing the way a concept is represented may alter what students learn. \\[11pt]
Furthermore, many concepts are built hierarchically on top of previously learned concepts. (This idea has been considered for some time within cognitive psychology, e.g. \cite{Fischer1980}, and more specifically within math cognition, e.g. \cite{Hazzan1999}.) Clearly the ability to learn higher-order concepts depends on understanding of the simpler concepts they are built upon. Thus we expect that the representations used to teach a concept can also affect student's understanding of the concepts which build upon it.\\[11pt]
In this project, I explored these issues of how examples change learning of a concept, and the concepts built upon it. I examined these issues within the area of mathematical cognition, specifically the learning of cyclic groups in group theory. I have built upon the extensive past work on examples in mathematical pedagogy research. For example, Mitchell Nathan's work has explored the effect ordering of abstract and applied problems in the curriculum has on learning mathematics \cite{Nathan2012}, Markant \& Gureckis have explored the effects of choosing or passively receiving examples when learning categories \cite{Markant2014}, and Larry Lesser has considered using counterintuitive examples to engage students \cite{Lesser1998}. More specifically, Kaminski et al. have investigated different presentations of cyclic groups \cite{Kaminski2008}, and these investigations provoked my interest in this topic. 

\subsection{Background: The Advantage(?) of Abstract Examples}
Kaminski and colleagues \cite{Kaminski2008} presented subjects with either a ``generic'' instantiation of a cyclic group of order 3, or a ``concrete'' one. (If you are unfamiliar with group theory, you may wish to review Appendix A at this point.) The examples are illustrated in figure \ref{kaminskitraining}. The generic presentation consists of some arbitrary geometric symbols, with enforced rules for combining them, and the concrete presentation consisted of an example with a narrative about combining cups of liquid, and finding the amount left over. There were two other concrete presentations (not shown) that were also used in some experimental sessions (using pizza slices and tennis balls, respectively, as the concrete objects.) They trained subjects to perform the operation in either the generic presentation or one to three concrete presentations. They then showed subjects the transfer domain shown in figure \ref{kaminskitransfer}, where the objects of the group are replaced by toys in a children's game. The subjects were explicitly told that this followed the same rules as the earlier examples, and that they should try to use their knowledge to predict the correct answers. Kaminski found that the subjects who learned the generic presentation performed better at this transfer than the subjects who learned the concrete presentation(s). From this, they concluded that ``instantiating an abstract concept in a concrete, contextualized manner appears to constrain that knowledge and hinder the ability to recognize the same concept elsewhere'' \cite{Kaminski2008}. \\[11pt]
\begin{figure} \centering \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth} \caption{Group Presentations} \label{kaminskitraining} \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/Kaminski2008Fig1.png} \end{subfigure} \\ \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth} \caption{Transfer Domain} \label{kaminskitransfer} \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/KaminskiTransfer.png} \end{subfigure} \caption{Group Presentations from \cite{Kaminski2008}} \end{figure}\noindent
However, Kaminski and colleagues have been thoroughly criticized over these choices of the initial presentations and the transfer domain. For example, Matthew G. Jones pointed out that in the concrete presentation ``the feature in question ... is the physical objects that behave like quantities'' and the problems can be solved by adding and subtracting, whereas in the generic presentation ``the symbols used do not appear to represent \emph{quantities}, and are not combined,'' and the transfer task, similarly ``does not exhibit a quantitative feature; instead it is another version of the generic instatiation with a different contextualization.'' Thus he concludes that ``The transfer task is more similar to the generic instantiation than to the concrete ones'' \cite{Jones2009}. In a response to these critiques, Kaminski et al. asserted that the generic and transfer domains were not more similar, because after describing the domains to a set of subjects, without teaching them the rules for combinations, and asking them to rate the similarity between domains, they did not find any significant differences in rated similarity \cite{Kaminski2009}. However, not presenting the rules makes it difficult to claim this comparison truly captures the similarity between the domains. \\[11pt]
For example, one aspect of the domains which is different is the asymmetry between 1 and 2, based on the subjects previous arithmetic knowledge. Although in the abstract sense, it is clear that the generic domain and the concrete are isomorphic, in the generic domain the symmetry between the two non-identity elements is clear, circle circle = diamond, and diamond diamond = circle. While the rules that $1+1=2$ and $2+2=1$ do follow from the presentation in the numeric case, there is a fundamental asymmetry to the arithmetic interpretations of them (i.e. $1+1 = 2$ because $1/3$ cup two times makes $2/3$ cups, but $2+2 = 1$ because $2/3$ cup two times makes 1 and $1/3$ cups, and we throw away the full cup to get back to $1/3$). We suspect this asymmetry may be to blame for the worse transfer performance, since students looking for a cue to map one object to 1 would not find any such specific cue. Similarly, if the notion of generators had been discussed in the study, students would probably have been biased to choose 1 as a generator, even though 2 is an equally good choice, whereas in the generic case there would be no such bias. Students' pre-conceptions about the examples in question can bias their understanding of the mathematical structure being presented. \\[11pt]
This idea that the learning is changed by the superficial appearance of the presentation is supported by De Bock et al., in their replication of Kaminski's study \cite{DeBock2011}. In this study, they compared the transfer from the generic domain to the concrete, and found that it was worse than the transfer from the concrete domain to a new concrete domain, or from an abstract to an abstract. Thus, each representation was better for transferring to representations similar to it. Furthermore, they asked subjects to give a free response justifying their answer to a difficult problem, and graded it on the ideas that it contained. They found that generic-presentation group subjects were learning group-theoretic ideas better (although they still attained very little understanding of them), but that concrete-presentation group subjects were learning the ideas of modular arithmetic as well as some ideas of group theory. Thus, the choice of representation had an effect not just on transfer, but on the concepts being inferred. \\[11pt]
However, De Bock et al.\ did not thoroughly explore this idea. They asked only one question of subjects, and were only able to grade on the concepts the subjects explicitly mentioned, so they may have missed understanding which the subjects did not choose to explain, either because it seemed obvious or because they were not comfortable enough with the concept.\\[11pt]
Furthermore, both Kaminski et al. and De Bock et al. omitted many essential features of real educational settings. They did not include much pedagogical explanation of the concepts in question, instead presenting the concepts as a set of rules that only had meaning by their relation to the subjects previous knowledge (hence only in the ``concrete'' cases). They tested only on transfer to an identical concept, whereas most examples in math instruction are intended to illustrate something more general (a teacher does not show students that $5+6 = 11$ just so they can add 5 and 6 in the future, but rather to illustrate the more general principles of addition, carrying, etc.) Because of this, they only examined understanding within the context of a computational problem, instead of considering subjects learning at multiple levels of understanding. I believe the higher levels are also important, due to the hierarchical organization of group theoretic concepts. 
\subsection{Group Theory Concept Hierarchy}
In service of understanding the organization of concepts in group theory, we propose some levels of understanding that students may attain, analogous to Van Hiele's levels of development in geometry \cite{Burger1986}:
\begin{description}
\item[Level 1 -- Individual Group Structure:] Students can perform the group operation in a group (or groups).
\item[Level 2 -- Individual Groups Properties:] Students can recognize and explain group-theoretic elements in a group or groups, e.g. identities and inverses.
\item[Level 3 -- Families of Groups:] Students can understand the patterns shared by families of groups, e.g. cyclic or dihedral groups, and can reason about them without recourse to specific member groups.
\item[Level 4 -- Group Morphisms:] Students understand the concepts of homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and related concepts like normal subgroups, kernels, etc.
\item[Level 5 -- Category Theory:] Students can reason about groups in an abstract way, as a category with relations to other categories, without recourse to any specific groups or group families (except insofar as some families of groups form sub-categories of $\mathsf{Grp}$).
\end{description}
(Please note that these levels are speculation based on our own understanding of group theory, and we are not claiming that students will necessarily proceed linearly through these levels. This is a topic which would justify its own investigation. Nevertheless, we think the idea of these levels provide a useful scaffold for understanding the design of our experiment.) \\[11pt]
At each level of understanding, there are relationships back to the previous levels, and all understanding of higher levels is grounded upon understanding the lower ones. Indeed, Orit Hazzan has suggested that students learning a new concept in abstract algebra reduce the level of abstraction by relying on properties they understand in more concrete examples \cite{Hazzan1999}. In this project, we manipulated the representation used to illustrate level 1, and compared how subjects learned concepts at levels 1, 2, and 3. 
\subsection{General Experimental Overview}
We conducted a series of experiments investigating the effects of representations, using two isomorphic representations of a cyclic group, which begin to address these issues by contrasting different representations of the group operation. One representation is based on a visuospatial manipulation involving counting around the verticies of a polygon, and the other is based on arithmetic. We used the group theoretic concepts of identities, inverses, and generators, as well as generalization from specific examples of cyclic groups to a generic cyclic group of order $n$ to investigate the effects of these representations at different levels of the concept hierarchy. 
\section{Experiment 1}
\subsection{Introduction}
In our first experiment, we explored whether the representations we chose produced differential understanding between the groups, and if so, at what level(s) of the concept hierarchy.
\subsection{Materials \& Methods} 
All materials can be found can be found on our github (https://github.com/lampinen/fyp cyclic groups), including complete versions of our experiments, which can be downloaded and run, or viewed using github's html preview. \\[11pt]
The experimental layout was as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Training on group operation (order 6 group)
\item Training on concepts of identity, inverses, and generators
\item Test of ability to transfer concepts to a new cyclic group (order 9)
\item Test of ability to formulate concepts at a general level about a family of groups (order $n$)
\end{enumerate}
We taught the subjects to perform a group operation using a cyclic group of order 6 (using one of two representations, between subjects), and then taught them the concepts of identities, inverses, and generators using this operation. The instruction for identities, inverses, and generators was the same between experimental groups (we did not need to refer to the specifics of the underlying operation). We then tested their transfer of these concepts to a cyclic group of order 9. (These group orders were chosen in order to have enough elements for demonstrations of concepts like inverses, and to have sufficiently many generating and non-generating elements to make the generator questions interesting). Finally, we tested subjects for understanding of the generic case by using a cyclic group with an unspecified order (i.e. order $n$). \\[11pt]
These tests address several levels of the hierarchy I proposed above. The learning of each group operation occurs at \textbf{Level 1}, the learning of identities, inverses and generators, as well as their transfer to a new explicit cyclic group occurs at \textbf{Level 2}, and the transfer to an generic cyclic group of order $n$ occurs at \textbf{Level 3}. (We did not investigate the higher levels within this study, although some of the concepts in \textbf{Level 4}, e.g. homomorphisms might not be too difficult to explain in the context of cyclic groups, and would provide an interesting ground for future investigations.)  
\subsubsection{Group Presentations}
Each experimental group received a different presentation of the cyclic groups. We have chosen these to compare an operational structure based on modular arithmetic, which is easily explained as a slight variation on regular arithmetic, with a more visually concrete example based on counting around a polygon, which allows subjects to develop a visual intuition, but which is not as directly familiar as standard arithmetic, although subjects may find analogies, e.g. to clocks. \\[11pt] 
For the modular arithmetic presentation, we presented the group operation as $+_6$, and we explained to subjects that to compute $+_6$ you add the two numbers, and then subtract $6$ if your result is $6$ or bigger.\\[11pt]
For the polygon representation, we presented the group operation in the form of rotating an arrow around a polygon. We wrote the group operation as $\hex$, an $n$ sided polygon containing the numeral $n$, and provided the subjects with a visual aid like figure \ref{hexagonex}. The diagram that subjects were provided was interactive, so that they could click or click and drag to move the arrow around the polygon. (The diagram was provided on each problem in the experiment.)
\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../figures/hexagon_arrow.png} \caption{Order 6 polygon figure} \label{hexagonex} \end{figure} \noindent
We explained to subjects that to compute $\hex$ you point the arrow in the hexagon to the first number, and then move it the second number of spaces clockwise. The number that the arrow points at is your result. In our training presentation, we used $\hex$, and gave examples such as $4 \hex 4 = 2$, because 4 steps clockwise from 4 makes the arrow point at 2. \\[11pt]
After showing several examples, we allowed subjects to practice on 10 problems, and if their accuracy was below 80\%, they were given an additional 10 practice problems. On all of these problems, the subjects received feedback on their answers and an explanation of the correct answer. 
\subsubsection{Indentities \& Inverses}
Next, we explained the concept of identity by stating that 0 is the identity because when you combine it with anything, you get the same thing back. We gave two examples to illustrate this. (This, and all subsequent concepts, was explained in exactly the same way to the different experimental groups, except for the differences in the operation symbols used. For the remainder of the paper, when presenting material that both experimental groups saw, I will alternate use of the operation symbols.)\\[11pt]
Similarly, we explained the concept of inverses by saying something's inverse is what you need to combine with that thing to get to the identity. For example, the inverse of 1 is 5, because $1 \hex 5 = 0$ and $5 +_6 1 = 0$. We then allowed subjects to find inverses for all other group elements as practice, and subjects received feedback on their answers and an explanation of the correct answer.
\subsubsection{Generators}
Finally, we taught the subjects the idea of generators, by explaining that a generator can make every other element of the group by combining with itself. For example, 1 is a generator under $+_6$, because $1 = 1$, $2 = \hex 1$, etc. However, 2 is not a generator under $+_6$, because $2 = 2$, $4 = 2 +_6 2$, $0 = 2\hex 2 \hex 2$, but there is no way to make 1, 3, or 5. We then allowed subjects to find whether each of the remaining elements generates the group as practice, and provided them feedback on their answers and an explanation of the correct answer.
\subsection{Transfer Test}
We first tested the subjects transfer of concepts to the cyclic group of order 9, presented either as $+_9$, or $\nonagon$ with the visual aid in figure \ref{nonagonex}. 
\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../figures/nonagon_arrow.png} \caption{Order 9 polygon figure} \label{nonagonex} \end{figure} \noindent
We allowed the subjects one practice problem (with feedback) on the new operation, to ensure that they understood it. We then asked the subjects questions to test their knowledge of the concepts outlined in each section above, namely:
\begin{itemize} 
\item A set of seven problems with the group operation, e.g. $6 \nonagon 4 = ?$, with subjects asked to provide an explanation of their answers for two of them.
\item One problem on the identity under the operation, with explanation.
\item Three inverse problems for the group, with explanation for one of them.
\item Four generators questions (two generators, two non-generators), with justification for one generator and one non-generator.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Generalization Test}
Finally, we told subjects we were now considering a order $n$ cyclic group, presented either as $+_n$, or $\ngon$ with the visual aid shown in figure \ref{ngonex}. (Unlike the other visual aids, in this one the arrow would rotate freely, and would not ``snap'' to the vertices, to avoid implicitly indicating a specific number of vertices to subjects.) 
\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{../figures/ngon_arrow.png} \caption{Order $n$ polygon figure} \label{ngonex} \end{figure} \noindent
We then asked them the following questions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the identity under $+_n$?
\item Two questions on giving formulas for inverses under $\ngon$, for 1 and for an arbitrary element $x$.
\item Two free-response questions on which elements are generators. 
\item Four true/false questions on which elements are generators, successively narrowing in on a correct statement about non-generators (If an element $x$ is not a generator under $+_n$, $x$ must be a multiple of a divisor of $n$.)
\item Three always/sometimes/never questions about generators. (E.g. If an element $x$ is a generator under $\ngon$, is its inverse a generator always, sometimes, or, never?) 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hypothesis}
Our hypothesis was that there would be a difference in learning between the subject groups at several levels of understanding, and a presentation that is beneficial at one level may be deleterious at the next, and even on different types of questions within the same level. (We had no a priori theory to predict which concepts will be more easily learned from which examples, so our results must be interpreted with this in mind.)
\subsubsection{Analysis}
We chose to analyse the data via a mixed-effects linear regression on the question-by-question scores of the subjects, with the fixed effects being question type (including the group order in which it was presented), presentation, the interaction of those two, the effect of having a high math background (defined as algebra II, trigonometry, statistics, or above), and a random effect of subject. The results presented are taken from this analysis. (We did not compute multiple comparisons correction in our analyses, we instead validated them in later experiments. These results must be interpreted with this in mind.) 
\subsubsection{Implementation details}
We performed this experiment on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, using high-reputation subjects (over 85\% approval rate), and using subject tracking (so we could run follow-up and replication studys on Mechanical Turk without having the same subjects participate and contaminate the results). The task was developed using JSPsych framework with a custom plugin to integrate the interactive polygon diagrams for each question, hosted on Stanford's servers, and embedded in the Mechanical Turk page.  
\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{Operation}
There was no significant difference in the performance on the basic operation questions between the experimental groups (see Figure \ref{ex1_op}) in either the order 6 group ($\beta = 0.006$, $t = 0.18$, $p = 0.86$) or the order 9 group ($\beta = -0.009$, $t = -0.26$, $p = 0.79$). These are the questions where the representation taught differed between the experimental groups. Both groups performed quite well, with over 90\% accuracy.

\end{figure} 
\subsubsection{Secondary Concepts}
Despite the fact that the experimental groups did not significantly differ on performing the operation, and the instruction on the secondary concepts was identical between experimental groups, we did find significant differences on some of these secondary concepts. First, for inverses the polygon group was significantly worse at finding the inverse of non-zero elements in the order 9 group ($\beta = -0.169$, $t=-3.73$, $p < 0.001$), but better at finding the inverse of zero (see Figure \ref{ex1_in}) in the order 6 group ($\beta = 0.66$, $t=9.13$, $p < 0.001$). (Unfortunately we did not include an inverse of zero question in the order 9 group in this experiment, so we only have data from the order 6 group.)

\caption{Experiment 1 -- Inverse Results}
\label{ex1_in}
\end{figure}\noindent 
Second, the polygon group was significantly better at identifying elements that were generators (order 6: $\beta = 0.164$, $t = 2.27$, $p = 0.02$; order 9: $\beta = 0.184$, $t = 3.45$, $p < 0.001$). However, the modular group performed better at the T/F questions about generators in the order $n$ group ($\beta = -0.11$, $t = -2.60$, $p = 0.009$). (See Figure \ref{ex1_gen}.)

\label{ex1_gen}
\end{figure}\noindent 
\subsection{Discussion}
The results show that, despite the fact that the experimental groups did not differ at learning the initial operation, they did differ in their ability to understand the subsequent concepts built upon it. Furthermore, one representation was not generally ``better'' than the other, they both had strengths and weaknesses. Thus our hypotheses were confirmed, at least in this initial experiment. However, because  \\[11pt]
Although we have not fully explored these factors, we do have some post-hoc hypotheses for the pattern of results we observed, based on responses to problems where we asked the subjects to explain their answers. We have not been able to quantitatively assess these hypotheses, so they should be treated as somewhat speculative at this point.\\[11pt]
\textbf{Inverses:} It appears that the modular representation may have cued the subjects to recognize a formula underlying most the inverses, namely that the inverse of $x$ is $n-x$. This would not be as obvious for the polygon group, which mostly found inverses by counting, which is less reliable. However, the formula $x^{-1} = n-x$ breaks when $x = 0$, because the inverse of $0$ is $0$, not $n$. We suspect that subjects in the polygon group made more mistakes counting than the modular group on inverses of non-zero elements, but the modular group subjects were misled by the formula when computing the inverse of zero. \\[11pt]
\textbf{Generators:} There is a spatial structure to the generator questions in the polygon case which may assist in solving them, for example finding if $5$ is a generator on the nonagon, we get the sequence $5 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow \cdots$. It might be more clear to someone seeing the polygon how precisely this sequence would fill in the gaps to generate all the numbers. By contrast, in the order $n$ case, it is difficult or impossible to use these spatial intuitions, so the more formulaic understanding cued by the modular representation might be beneficial.

\section{Experiment 2}
\subsection{Introduction}
In our second experiment, we had two goals. First, we wanted to replicate the results of our first experiment with a planned analysis (to ensure that the effects were real and not just chance variation, since we didn't have \textit{a priori} hypotheses about which representation would be superior for which types of questions). Second, we wanted to explore whether we could teach both representations to the subjects and encourage them to integrate the polygon and modular methods into a hybrid representation (while keeping total instruction time approximately the same), and if this would cause improved performance across all types of questions. 
\subsection{Materials \& Methods} 
All materials can be found can be found on our github (https://github.com/lampinen/fyp cyclic groups), including complete versions of our experiments, which can be downloaded and run, or viewed using github's html preview. The materials and methods were identical to experiment 1, except:\\[11pt]
\textbf{Hybrid group:} We added a hybrid group, which was taught both representations initially (with polygon labeled as ``polygon'', and modular labeled as ``arithmetic''). We encouraged subjects to integrate these representations by adding a question and explanation about how the different representations worked the same, giving them a chance to reflect on the isomorphism between them (though we did not use that word). Furthermore, we asked subjects on alternating operation practice questions to use the different representations, to encourage them to achieve facility with each representation. (The hybrid group saw the same number of practice questions as the other experimental groups.)\\[11pt]
\textbf{Added questions:} Because we added a question to the hybrid group asking them how the representations worked the same, we added questions to the other experimental groups asking and explaining how the operations worked, giving them a chance to reflect on the representation. We also added a question about the inverse of zero in the order 9 group, to see if subjects in the modular condition performed better on it after getting feedback on their previous answer. \\[11pt]
\textbf{Other:} Typo fixes, wording adjustments, and other small changes to the experiment. As mentioned above, the versions can be compared on our GitHub.
\subsection{Hypotheses}
We hypothesized that we would replicate the results of our first experiment, namely: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item The modular and polygon groups would not differ significantly in their learning of the operation.
\item The modular group would be significantly better than the polygon group at finding the inverse of non-zero elements.
\item The polygon group would be significantly better than the modular group at finding the inverse of zero.
\item The polygon group would be significantly better than the modular group at identifying elements that are generators in the specific groups.
\item The modular group would be significantly better than the polygon group at answering T/F questions about generators in the order $n$ group.
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, we hypothesized that the hybrid group would achieve approximately the maximum performance of the two groups, i.e.:
\begin{itemize}
\item The hybrid group would be significantly better than the modular group whenever the polygon group performed better.
\item The hybrid group would not significantly differ from the modular group when the modular group performed better.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Analysis}
We analyzed the data via a planned mixed-effects linear regression on the question-by-question scores of the subjects, with the fixed effects being question type (including the group order in which it was presented), presentation, the interaction of those two, the effect of having a high math background (defined as algebra II, trigonometry, statistics, or above), and a random effect of subject. The results presented are taken from this analysis.
\subsubsection{Implementation details}
We performed this experiment on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, using high-reputation subjects (over 85\% approval rate), and using subject tracking (so we could run follow-up and replication studys on Mechanical Turk without having the same subjects participate and contaminate the results). The task was developed using JSPsych framework with a custom plugin to integrate the interactive polygon diagrams for each question, hosted on Stanford's servers, and embedded in the Mechanical Turk page.  
\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{Operation}
We replicated our result that there was no significant difference in the performance on the basic operation questions between the modular and polygon experimental groups (see Figure \ref{ex2_op}) in either group order (order 6: $\beta = 0.02$, $t = 0.735$, $p = 0.46$; order 9: $\beta = 0.02$, $t = 0.63$, $p = 0.53$). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the hybrid and modular groups (order 6: $\beta = -0.02$, $t = -0.72$, $p = 0.47$; order 9: $\beta = 0.04$, $t = 1.10$, $p = 0.27$).

\subsubsection{Secondary Concepts}
We replicated our results that the modular group performed better at inverses of non-zero elements (order 6: $\beta = -0.11$, $t = -2.59$, $p = 0.009$; order 9: $\beta = -0.07$, $t = -1.48$, $p = 0.13$), and the polygon group performed better at inverse of zero questions (order 6: $\beta = 0.68$, $t = 8.842$, $p < 0.001$; order 9: $\beta = 0.44$, $t = 5.80$, $p < 0.001$). (Note that the modular group performed worse than the polygon group even in the order 9 group, once they had already seen an example with feedback.) The hybrid group was not significantly worse than the modular group at inverses of non-zero elements (order 6: $\beta = -0.007$, $t = -0.173$, $p = 0.86$; order 9: $\beta = 0.08$, $t = 1.56$, $p = 0.12$), and was significantly better at inverses of zero (order 6: $\beta = 0.46$, $t = 5.95$, $p < 0.001$; order 9: $\beta = 0.38$, $t = 4.91$, $p < 0.001$). (See Figure \ref{ex2_in}.) However, it is clear that the hybrid group is not initially performing as well as the polygon group on this question, so there is still room for improvement. \\[11pt]

Furthermore, we replicated our result that the polygon group is better at identifying generators in the order 9 group ($\beta = 0.19$, $t = 3.37$, $p < 0.001$), and we replicated our result that the modular group is better at T/F questions about generators ($\beta = -0.12$, $t = -2.71$, $p = 0.007$). The hybrid group is significantly better than the modular group at identifying generators in the group order where our previous finding replicated ($\beta = 0.25$, $t = 4.31$, $p < 0.001$), and is not significantly worse at the T/F questions ($\beta = -0.042$, $t = -0.98$, $p = 0.33$). (See Figure \ref{ex2_gen}.) However, it appears that the hybrid group may not be achieving performance completely on par with the modular group on these questions.

\subsection{Post-hoc analyses}
We conducted a number of post-hoc analyses in an attempt to understand the differences between the groups, and the pattern of performance of the hybrid group. 
\subsubsection{Diagram use}
We hypothesized above that the polygon group's superior performance on identifying generators was due to the ability to use the spatial structure of the polygon to more easily visualize the elements generated by an element. One possible prediction of this hypothesis would be that within the polygon group, interaction with the diagram might be predictive of success on these questions. (Of course, we could only record the interactions with the mouse, while many subjects may have just gazed or pointed at the diagram to use it in their thinking. Furthermore, the use of the diagram may be confounded with overall engagement. Our results must be interpreted with this in mind.) \\[11pt]
We performed a mixed-model logistic regression on data from the polygon and hybrid subjects, predicting correct answers by whether or not they used the diagram (and a random effect of subject). We found that using the diagram was significantly predictive of success on the questions ($\beta=1.90$, $z = 2.76$, $p = 0.006$). Furthermore, this effect was present even when controlling for reaction time ($\beta = 1.62$, $z = 2.26$, $p = 0.024$), which might suggest that engagement alone wasn't the driving factor, and the effect was significant or trending within the polygon and hybrid conditions individually, suggesting that both benefitted. \\[11pt]
Using analogous mixed-model logistic regressions across the full data from the hybrid and polygon groups, we found that on all questions in the experiment (not just generator questions) that using the diagram was significantly predictive of success ($\beta = 1.26$, $z = 6.93$, $p < 0.001$), even when controlling for reaction time ($\beta = 1.42$, $z = 7.53$, $p < 0.001$). However, the estimated effect sizes were slightly smaller than for the generator questions. Further data is needed to clarify this pattern.
\subsubsection{Hierarchical modeling of hybrid subjects}
One of our main goals for this experiment was to test the idea of a hybrid group which would attain better performance than either the polygon or modular group individually. Although we found the hybrid group did perform better, it did not seem to achieve truly maximal performance. One explanation for this might be that some subjects were just picking one representation and using it consistently, while others were really integrating both and performing optimally (at the maximal level of the two). We attempted to model this with a hierarchical model by assuming that the data were generated by the following process: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item With probability $\theta$, the subject would integrate the material, and would perform optimally in the sense that their data would be best fit by assuming they picked the optimal representation on each question (or equivalently, that their regression coefficients were the element-wise maximum of the regression coefficients of the two other groups). 
\item If the subjects did not integrate (probability $1-\theta$), they would pick the polygon representation with probability $\phi$, and the modular representation with probability $1-\phi$, and their data would be best fit by the coefficients for the respective group.
\end{enumerate} 
We fit this model to the data using expectation-maximization, and estimated that $\theta = 0.53, \phi = 0.38$ (Aikake information criterion $LL=-821.9$), so the data are best fit under this model by assuming that a little more than half the subjects are perfectly integrating, and those that aren't are choosing the modular representation over the polygon almost two-thirds of the time. We used the Aikake information criterion to compare this model ($AIC = 1647.8$) to models where all subjects chose modular ($AIC=1829.6$), all chose polygon ($AIC = 1720.5$), 50\% chose each ($AIC = 1678.8$), and all subjects performed optimally ($AIC = 1689.9$). The full model fits better than any of these comparison models. However, there are many other possible ways people could use the two representations (such as picking arbitrarily on each question), so further investigation is needed.
\subsubsection{Analysis of hybrid subject word use}
We also attempted to investigate the hybrid subjects' use of different representations by the presence of words in their explanations of answers that corresponded to one of the representations or another. First, we hand-crafted classifiers for the polygon and modular condition, respectively, based on the most common words that were specific to the condition (Polygon condition: move, spaces, clockwise, steps, arrow, hexagon, nonagon, ngon, spots, positions; Modular condition: add, subtract, plus, minus, +). We counted the occurrences of each of these words in each explanation, and then classified it as polygon if the polygon-word-count was higher, and as modular if the modular-word-count was higher. This produced highly specific, though not especially sensitive, classifiers for the conditions, see table \ref{wordusevaltable} for comparisons of classifier estimate of condition versus true condition across all questions with explanations in experiment 1.

\label{wordusevaltable}
\end{table} 
Using these classifiers on the hybrid data from experiment 2, we found that the hybrid subjects were classified as using more polygon words on 58 questions total across all subjects, and more modular words on 33 questions. We compared scores across classifier groups, and found some intriguing patterns, see table \ref{worduseresultstable}. On questions about the inverse of non-zero elements, hybrid subjects rated as using more polygon words appeared more accurate than those not using more polygon words, and those using more modular words appeared less accurate than those not using more modular words (table \ref{polyclassintable} \& \ref{modclassintable}). Similarly, on questions where they had to identify a generator, hybrid subjects rated as using more polygon words appeared more accurate than those not using more polygon words, and those using more modular words also appeared more accurate than those not using more modular words, but more subjects used polygon words than modular (table \ref{polyclassintable} \& \ref{modclassintable}). \\[11pt]

These results should not be read too strongly, because they are based on a few data points, because we did not ask for explanations on every question, and many subjects did not use specific words in their explanations. In part, this may be due to our design, by attempting to homogenize the language we used when presenting more advanced concepts to subjects, and remove references to the underlying operation, we implicitly encouraged subjects to give explanations that used representation-agnostic language (e.g. ``5 can make all the other elements'' instead of ``using 5 we can reach each other point on the nonagon''). We also tried using more general classifiers that were derived directly from the data, using the 20 or 40 most selective words and estimating the posterior probabilities from these, but while these classifiers were more sensitive, they were significantly less specific, so we think the interpretation of those results are problematic.   
\subsection{Discussion}
Our results generally replicated those of the original experiment. The only results that failed to replicate were the polygon group performing better at identifying generators in the order 6 group, and the polygon group performing worse at the inverse of non-zero elements in the order 9 group, but since each did replicate in the other group order it is possible that these were just a fluke. A further experiment to verify this would be ideal. However, the general pattern of results remains, and thus our original conclusions that the representation can have effects on learning of more abstract concepts remain. \\[11pt]
Furthermore, the hybrid group performed approximately maximally well, although it did not appear to achieve truly maximal performance, so there is still progress to be made. Our post-hoc analyses suggest that some subjects may have integrated the results better than others, so there may be some individual variation. However, these results at least begin to suggest that the use and integration of multiple representations could be an important direction to pursue in future math pedagogy research. \\[11pt]
Finally, in our post-hoc analyses we produced some corroborating evidence that the polygon condition is better at identifying generators because of the spatial structure of generation on the polygon, by showing that using the diagram improved performance on these questions. 
\section{Conclusion}
We explored the way representation of concepts in mathematics pedagogy affects understanding of the concept being exemplified, and of more abstract concepts built upon it, using elementary group theory as our test domain. We found that even if two representations produce equal performance on a basic concept, they can produce differential understanding of the more abstract concepts based upon it. Furthermore, it does not appear that there is always a clear advantage of one representation over another, instead a representation may be more useful for some types of questions, and less useful for others. We also identified a possible strategy for improving performance: namely teaching multiple representations while encouraging subjects to integrate them. Preliminary data suggests that this may have positive effects even if the total instruction time is approximately the same. We think that these findings provide a contribution to the discussion of representation in math cognition, and an exciting direction for new research in math pedagogy.

\section{Appendix A: A Brief, Selective Introduction to Group Theory}
Groups are mathematical structures that provide us with a nice way of doing something like arithmetic with things besides the ordinary numbers, like symmetries of an object or permutations, or with smaller sets of ordinary numbers (as in this paper). They have applications throughout mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science. Here I present the formal definition of a group with informal intuitions in italics. A \textbf{group} consists of a set $G$ (\emph{some objects}) and a binary operation $*: G\times G \rightarrow G$ (\emph{a way of combining two objects to get another object}) such that:  
\begin{itemize}
\item $G$ is \textbf{closed} under $*$, that is $a*b \in G$ for all $a,b \in G$. (\emph{Combining two of the objects you started with gives you another of the objects you started with.}) 
\item $*$ is \textbf{associative}, $a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c$ for all $a,b,c \in G$. (\emph{It doesn't matter how you parenthesize the operation, just like addition or multiplication.})
\item There is an \textbf{identity} element $e \in G$ such that $\forall x \in G, e*x = x*e = x$. (\emph{There's something that when you combine it with anything else has no effect, just like multiplying by one gives you the same number back.})
\item Each element $x \in G$ has an \textbf{inverse} element $x^{-1} \in G$ such that $x*x^{-1} = x^{-1}*x = e$. (\emph{There's something you can combine with each element to get back to the identity, just like $2 \times 0.5 = 1$.})
\end{itemize}
For example, if we take $G$ to be the numbers less than $4$, $G = \{0,1,2,3\}$, and define a new operation $*$ by $$a*b = \begin{cases} a+b & \text{if } a+b < 4 \\ a+b-4 & \text{if } a+b \geq 4 \end{cases}$$
$G$ and $*$ form a group, called the \textbf{cyclic group of order 4}. For example, in this group $1*1 = 2$, $2 * 3 = 5-4 = 1$ because $5 \geq 4$, $3*1 = 4-4 = 0$, etc. $0$ is the identity in this group, because $0*x = x*0 = x$ for any of $0,1,2,3$. Furthermore, the inverse of $1$ in the group is $3$, because $1*3 = 4-4 = 0$, the inverse of $2$ is $2$, and so on.\\[11pt]
There is a great deal of structure to groups, far more than there is space to explain here. The only topic of interest for us beyond these simple properties will be the concept of \textbf{generators}. An element $x$ generates a group if every other element of the group can be written as $x*x*\cdots*x$ for some number of $x$s. For example, in our cyclic group of order 4, defined above, 1 is a generator of the group because $1 = 1, 2 = 1 * 1, 3 = 1 * 1 * 1, 4 = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1$. Similarly, 3 is a generator because $3 = 3, 2 = 3 * 3, 1 = 3 * 3 * 3, 0 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3$. However, 2 is not a generator because $2 = 2, 0 = 2 * 2$, but there is no way to generate 1 or 3 using 2. This illustrates the only theorem we will give here: \\[11pt]
\textbf{Cyclic Group Generators Theorem:} In a cyclic group of order $n$, written as the integers $0$ to $n-1$, $x < n$ generates the group if and only if $x$ and $n$ are relatively prime (i.e. have no common factors except 1). \\[11pt]
