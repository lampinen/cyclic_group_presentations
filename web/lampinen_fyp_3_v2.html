It works exactly like "+hexagon+", except now you use the nonagon shown at the right. Equivalently, after adding the two numbers you subtract 9 if your result is 9 or greater.<br /><br />Do you see how the different ways of performing "+nonagon+" give the same result, just like with "+hexagon+"? By labeling the points of the nonagon with the numbers from 0 to 8, we ensure that when we combine two numbers under "+nonagon+", we only produce numbers between 0 and 8. When we use the arithmetic strategy, adding the second number to the first mimics counting around the nonagon, and subtracting 9 each time we get above 8 makes sure the results correspond to the numbers on the points of the nonagon.<br /><br />We'll give you one practice question with feedback to make sure you understand the new operation. After that, try to complete the remaining questions as accurately as possible."
