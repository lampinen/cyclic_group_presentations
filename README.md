# fyp_cyclic_groups

This repository contains the experiment and analysis code for my first experiment on the effect of superficial properties of examples when learning abstract algebra.

### Web
Contains the webpages for the experiments, which were run on mTurk. The experiments can be run by downloading this folder, or using github's html preview mode. The naming convention is as follows:
fyp_1_\* = experiment 1, fyp_2_\* = experiment 2, and the subsequent numbers denote experimental conditions. Experiment 1: 0 = modular, 1 = polygon, 2 = modular with prompt, 3 = polygon with prompt. Experiment 2,3: 0 = modular, 1 = polygon, 2 = hybrid. 

### Analysis
Contains the code used to analyze the data, generate the figures for the writeup, etc. 

### Writeup
Contains the original proposal, and the writeup.

### Data
Contains anonymized data files from all participants.
